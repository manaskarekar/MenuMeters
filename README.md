MenuMeters
==========

`MenuMeters` is a set of CPU, memory, disk, and network monitoring tools for
macOS.  [Originally][original] created by Alex Harper, development stopped in
2015 and `MenuMeters` stopped working on OS X El Capitan.

A [fork] was created on GitHub and the compatibility issues with OS X were
fixed.  The fork is being actively maintained.

This fork of MenuMeters is known to work in El Capitan, Sierra, High Sierra,
Mojave and Catalina.

I created this fork because I felt the need of streamlining the build and
release process.  I added a `Makefile` which builds `MenuMeters` from scratch,
and creates a DMG archive containing a PKG installer.

Building
--------

`MenuMeters` can be built from sources using the following command:

````
$ make
````

Installing
----------

`MenuMeters` can be installed downloading the DMG archive of the [latest
release][latest] or from the [MenuMeters web page][mm-web].  If you prefer to
build the installer from source, just follow the instructions in
[Build](#build).
